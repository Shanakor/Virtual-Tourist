# Virtual Tourist (4/5)

This is the fourth part of a five part series of sample apps created for [Udacity's Nanodegree "Become an iOS Developer"](https://udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003).

With Virtual Tourist you can put pins on a _MapView_. If you tap on a pin, images that are associated with these coordinates are downloaded
from Flickr.

Learning focus of this app was to learn how to use __CoreData__. This includes:

* Creation of suited database models
* Persistence of data at relevant moments
* Migration of data models to a newer version.
